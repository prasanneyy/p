      <h5 class="love">She's the only girl I want. She's the girl whom I want to spend my whole life with. Words aren't enough to express my love for her and how beautiful she is. She has the most beautiful eyes and smile, and everything about her is so perfect.  <br> <br>
Even her anger feels like her love to me. I know I'm not so perfect for her, but I'm trying to improve myself for her. We're too young to dream of forever, but I'm not going to give up on her at any cost. She's the girl I want to be with. Maybe we fight with each other sometimes, misunderstand each other, but we always end up saying sorry and clearing the misunderstanding between us.</h5>
